# Sherlock Project

#Simple password manager built with python (as a back-end) and discord client as a front-end

It uses argon2id for "Siging up" and scrypt for storing passwords securely with your own salts

It's a not serious project, thus don't store personal data

Wanna build or contribute ? Just clone the project on your machine and run the main script ("Don't forget to have all the 
packages installed, you just need to use the requirements.txt script").

#I'm wide open for pr's and stuff, thanks for attention :)

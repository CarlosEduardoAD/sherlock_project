# Sherlock Project

#Simple password manager built with python (as a back-end) and discord client as a front-end

It uses argon2id for "Siging up" and scrypt for storing passwords securely with your own salts

It's a not serious project, thus don't store personal data, if you wan't to look up for the code and learn (even 
with my pretty dirty code), be free !

#I'm wide open for pr's and stuff, thanks for attention :)
